      She is admitted to hospital and treated with IV amoxicillin and clarithromycin for the past week. However, since then her fever has persisted and she has developed foul smelling sputum.

      A chest x-ray is requested and an aspirate of pleural fluid is obtained. The results demonstrate a pH&lt;7.2.

      What is the most appropriate management?
